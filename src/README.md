Joining a grand tradition, I'm going to attempt and inevitably fail at
typesetting the notes for this class. Any mistakes are mine and are numerous.

I will do my best to keep my personal comments restricted to the remarks. Any
mistakes are mine. These notes will include no more SML code than was presented
in lecture.
