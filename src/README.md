# 15-417 HOT Compilation, Spring 2020

- Professor: Karl Crary

Joining a grand tradition, I'm going to attempt and inevitably give up at
typesetting the notes for this class.

Material is grouped by subject and is roughly ordered by when we covered them
in class. There is no separation by individual lectures. The order of material
in a given subsection is, roughly following class presentation order, but may
be reordered according to what I personally find to be clearer.

These are somewhat inspired by Nick Roberts' attempt, and a lot of the early
material is... well, not lifted, but definitely influenced by his explanations.

I will do my best to keep my personal comments restricted to the remarks. Any
mistakes are mine. These notes will include no more SML code than was presented
in lecture.
